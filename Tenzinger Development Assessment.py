#Tenzinger Development Assessment

#Goal: Calculate the monthly traveling reimbursement for each employee
#      Return a csv with the employee information, the travelling reimbursement
#      And the paydate (first monday of the month)

#steps:
#How many days are there each month
#When is the first monday of the month
#Calculate the reimbursement
#Add reimbursement and date to existing dataframe
#export as csv
#make streamlit app so that HR doesn't need to know python
